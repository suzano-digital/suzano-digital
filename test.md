Data Engineer Test

You are working in a project that uses public economic data to predict some directions regarding the paper price .

A Data Scientist in your project asks you to gather data from the **investing.com** website .

He needs the data from Chinese Caixin Services Index , Bloomberg Commodity Index  and USD/CNY **Daily**

He gaves you 3 website pages that you can get this information 

**Chinese Caixin Services Index**

https://br.investing.com/economic-calendar/chinese-caixin-services-pmi-596

He said that the graph below has exact the information that he needs  monthly data from 2012 till today

**Bloomberg Commodity Index**

https://br.investing.com/indices/bloomberg-commodity .

He said that he needs  monthly data from 1991 till now


**USD/CNY**

https://br.investing.com/currencies/usd-cny

He said that he needs  monthly data from 1991 till now

## Goal

You need to build a code that gets the data in a automatic way and load the data in tables as below :



| Chinese Caixin Services Index | 
| :---:  |
|date | 
|actual_state | 
|close | 
|forecast | 


| Bloomberg Commodity Index | 
| :---:  |
|date | 
|close | 
|open | 
|high | 
|low | 
|volume | 


| USD/CNY  | 
| :---:  |
|date | 
|close | 
|open | 
|high | 
|low | 
|volume | 



## Closing Remarks


- Use the programming language of your choice . (But we love Python, just a tip , i'm kidding it's up to you :D )
- Use the libraries that are already built to make your work easier (remember in the end of the day what is important is the job done)
- Use a database to store the data in tables format(dont use SQLlite)



**Seize this opportunity to demonstrate your skills in some data pipeline orchestration framework, containerization and cloud computing technology!**

Store your code in your Github account make it **private** 


Good luck!
